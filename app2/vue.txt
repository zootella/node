oh, it does work
well that was silly

>next steps
write the idnn99 generator
a list of templates that grows and shrinks
updating the parts of those templates
nesting two levels deep

make two kinds of things
a counter, that just has a one more button
a timer, that has start/stop/rest buttons
and then put those in two lists, with add and delete to make a new one
see how they can affect themselves
as well as communicate down to a layer that's separate from the data stuck to the page
maybe also have tabs at the top that hide and restore whole sets of things

once you have that, make stick and log with buttons and text fields
this is all easy, you just have to do it



uid9999zzzz




make a vue example that has a working button and input box
read guides and follow videos, but keep in mind that:
the only thing you need to make is stick and log and button in html



<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>

<div id="app">
	<p><button v-on:click="method1">My Button</button></p>
	<p><input type="text" v-on:input="method2"></p>
	
	
	<p>{{ title }}</p>
</div>


new Vue({
	el: '#app',
	data: {
		title: 'this is the starting message'
	},
	methods: {
		method1() {
			this.title = 'you clicked the button';
		},
		method2() {
			this.title = `you changed the text to "${ "TODO" }"`;	
		}
	}
});





$event.target.value
$event is a variable that vue makes for you in the scope of your method
target is the html element
value is specific to the dom, but in the case of an input box, is the text currently in the box















single list of things with buttons

fruit has
-name
-color
-quantity

there's a list of fruits

17 yellow bananas [more] [less]

global buttons at the top can add more, remove some, change colors, and change quantities







ok, you can get button presses out and get new data in
next might be getting this into electron and node
and just writing log and stick with it
you can worry about doing a full real ui later, you can tell from the docs that it's possible and maybe not even that hard, tabs and everything




here's what your going to make with vue
1 log and stick for exploringnode examples
2 the visual repl and subapps in the running process for backup/everpipe/pchan
3 the full ui for backup/everpipe/pchan
