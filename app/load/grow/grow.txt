//maybe one of them, and it'll tell us which one, called in here, so then you want to load all the others, in the appropriate order
/*
actually no, you don't have an entry points in library files, instead it's the tests for each file, and the tests can have loaded the whole library
so you maybe don't even need require statements in the different modules, because every user calls load, load calls them all in order, and then everybody has access to everything
so this can be really stupid simple
and is still better than going crazy on global because if you double-load, it will stop you
