this broken example is a variant of protection

app.js
high.js
low.js

app depends on high
high depends on low
app shouldn't be able to get to low, but it can, because we're sticking things on the global object


then try adding it to
global
module, this should work, right?





no, before that, just do this


list all the contents of the global object

add something to the global object

confirm that you can access it elsewhere just by loading that file
but not before loading that file
