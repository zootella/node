1 you tried to make generalized, finished icarus, and it didn't work because you can't see the general case until you've programmed up a few specific cases
2 it could have been easy to use browser-sync to make familiar, but it wasn't because it requires gulp and nodemon and express and socket.io, and it doesn't work in windows xp anyways
3 so go back to electron and make custom familiar there, and then use what you learned to see how you'll make generic Dialog in icarus





three more options

1 nodeunit custom, throws and you don't know why
2 nodeunit in separate process, parse the console it returns, do this
3 write your own compatible nodeunit, how hard would this be






icarusunit

require the test module
loop through all the exports
give each one a 'test' object of your own design
the external will call your test.ok, make sure those are true
make sure external called test.done() before you do the next one

yeah, this sounds like a pretty easy 100 lines of code, try it a bit just to figure out why you're wrong and it's really hard

ok, what about when a test finishes in another event, how do you deal with that, nodeunit can deal with that

yeah, let's parse the nodeunit output from another process instead



more features
you don't have to name tests, and they can be duplicates








/*
ok, error tells you red or green
and then everything's in output, just break on lines, and hide all the ones in the middle that don't start with that checkbox
*/


//		if (!line.starts("âœ”")) print(line);



//split as lines
//get numbers from the start and finish
//hide all the checkbox lines










/*



>what you'r egoing to show

if everything passed and was silent, nothing, just the count
if anything failed or said hi, all the lines formatted for not the terminal


*/
