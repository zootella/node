//show the demo where you think you can catch the exceptions, but it doesn't work because they're in separate functions

//watch leading promise youtube videos and pull in the best demos









/*

show different things you can do in a then function
return a value, and that value gets passed to the next function
return a promise, and it gets passed to the next function, after the promise has resolved





write a blog entry, then make a video where you talk through it with sandro, then post that to youtube, and link them to each other
best of both worlds, learning from video versus learning from text




loose wordpress, make it text files and then a script that builds it into html, and then have css
fancy features to add to code blocks
syntax highlighting
single click to copy, have a warning that you'll learn more by typing it in
single click to run on some site that runs javascript right in the browser, there are several

best of all, have this feature
just like the screenshots on getbot.com
click forward and back with little boxes that have arrows and highlight different parts of the code
this way, you can really point the user around the code as you go, this does this first, then resolves to this, and so on

make your own blog site just for code like that

instead of making the user click back or next, also have a little text box they can set the focus in, and then use the left and right arrow keys
